# Musical Windows

Musical Windows is an interactive web instrument that allows the user to experiment with a variety of musical scales while controlling rhythm, volume, and reverb. The audio aspects are entirely built on the Web Audio API.

## Teoria

[Teoria.js](https://github.com/saebekassebil/teoria), built by Jakob Miland, is a libary for musical theory. Musical Windows uses it to define the scales and notes that the user can choose between.
